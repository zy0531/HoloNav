# HoloNav_Test

Seamlessly visualize Augmented Reality (AR) cues in the real world in HoloLens 2 by giving GPS(Lattitude, Longitude)

Developed in Unity 2020.3.14f1

1. Receive GPS and IMU data from HoloNav via Bluetooth
2. Coordinate conversion - convert GPS to Unity Cartesian coordinates automatically (When read in GPS data)
3. North calibration by audio input - say "Calibrate" when the circle marker on the compass turns red

- Accuracy: 5m
- Test Area: 500m as a crow flies
